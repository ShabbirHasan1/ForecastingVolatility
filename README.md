# VolatilityForecast
Comparing historical volatility, close-to-close volatility, Parkinson volatility, Garman-Klass volatility and Rogers-Satchell volatility in the rolling window method to forecast future volatility

Volatility exhibits serial correlation. Future volatility over some period of time is correlated to volatility over the previous period of time when both periods of time are the same. This is the basis on which the rolling window method for forecasting future volatility is built. Here the rolling window method is used to forecast future volatility and comparisons are made between various estimators of true volatilit. This is repeated for various forecast periods.
